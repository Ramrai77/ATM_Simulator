This is a console-based ATM Simulator application built using core Python.
It simulates real-world ATM operations and focuses on logic building, OOPs, and error handling.

Technologies Used:

Python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)

File Handling

Exception Handling

Manual Testing

Features

User authentication using PIN

Balance inquiry

Cash withdrawal and deposit

File-based data storage

Error handling for invalid input and insufficient balance

Testing Approach

Designed manual test cases for ATM workflows

Validated edge cases such as wrong PIN and low balance
